#given an array of items, select with item is the dominator.

#In order to say that there is a Leader it should be more than halfe of the array
#[eagle, wolf, wolf, deer, wolf, eagle, wolf]
#eagle -> 2
#wolf -> 4
#deer -> 1
# the wolf is the leader because 4 > 7/2


#there are multiple solution to this problem
#1.- ItÂ´s to  count the ocurrence of each element having a O(n*n) because you can end up looping the array as many elements in has in the array
#2.- We can sort the array and the most common element will be in the middle then we cound the number of times it occurs in the array
    #if we pick a good sorting alghorithm we end up with an algorithm equal to the sorting algorithm -> best case scenario O(n log n)


#my solution uses a dictionary with has a Time complexity of O(n) in the worst case
